optimize how the program is represented in .prg (memory locations, instead of 0)
test jumping out of bounds (not possible with current notation)
modulo for addition/substraction?
implement multiplication algorithm (integer)
implement manual static frames
write base 10 and base 16
shift instructions so that the ones using an argument start with a 1

DONE use hexadecimal in .prg!!
