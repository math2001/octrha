The program loads 2 different values in r0 and r1, and then swaps them.


To swap r0 and r1, we do the following:


swap r0 and *cell
swap r1 and *cell
swap r0 and *cell

*23 (cell 23) is used as the cache

An other way of saying it (which isn't exactly the equivalent, but represents
the *intended* behaviour)

*cell = r0
r0 = r1
r1 = *cell
